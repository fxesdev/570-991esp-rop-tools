# 570-991esp-rop-tools
Some tools to help with rop building, (may work with other calcs)

__usage__

To use these tools you need some kind of python/web tool so other operating systems other than linux/unix/mac may be more difficult to run.

These tools will build your rop chain in my own language syntax.

syntax: `a:bcde(h) #<comment> {newline}`

and the output will be: `de bc xa xx #<comment> {newline}`

**INSTALL**

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxesdev/570-991esp-rop-tools/main/install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh
```
